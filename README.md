# Portfolio Project

My first personal portfolio website created using HTML5.

## Project Overview
This project showcases my journey as a beginner web developer. It includes sections about me, my skills, and a way to contact me. The goal is to demonstrate understanding of HTML structure, semantic elements, forms, and navigation.

## Setup Instructions
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. No additional installation or configuration is required.

## Code Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the website.
- `images/`: Directory containing project images (e.g., profile picture).
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Technical Details
- **HTML5**: Used semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` for better accessibility and structure.
- **Forms**: Implemented a contact form with input validation (e.g., `required`, `type="email"`).
- **Navigation**: Used anchor tags (`<a>`) with `href="#section-id"` for smooth internal linking.

## Testing Evidence
- Tested in Chrome and Edge browsers.
- Validated HTML structure using W3C markup validation service.
- Form fields require input before submission.

## Concepts Learned
- How to structure an HTML document.
- The importance of semantic HTML tags.
- Creating forms and handling user input.
- Adding images and ensuring accessibility with `alt` text.
